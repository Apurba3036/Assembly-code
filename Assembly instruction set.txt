We have to assign a value in 'AH' register and then occur an interrupt to take user input or show output in assembly.
>For  single character input we have to put '1' in AH
>For   single character output we have to put '2' in AH
>For   string output, put '9' in AH

Then call an interrupt to happen this. Generally call  'INT 21H' for input and output.

>INC is used to add 1 to the contents of a register or
 memory location and DEC subtracts 1 from a register

 registers or a register and a memory location.
